ChemicalTagger:

  ChemicalTagger is a phrase-based semantic NLP tool for parsing the language of chemical experiments. Tagging is based on a modular architecture and uses a combination of OSCAR, domain-specific regex and English taggers to identify parts-of-speech. ANTLR grammar is used to structure this into tree-based phrases. It takes a string as input and produces an XML document as output.
