<p>The title compound was synthesized as described in the
literature. To glycine (1.00 mmol) and potassium hydroxide (1.00
mmol) in 10 ml of methanol and 5 ml of water was added
2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (1.00 mmol in 10 ml of methanol)
dropwise. The yellow solution was stirred for 2.0 h at 333 K. The
resultant mixture was added dropwise to Cu(II) nitrate hexahydrate
(1.00 mmol) and pyridine (1.00 mmol) in an aqueous methanolic
solution (20 ml, 1:1 <i>v</i>/<i>v</i>), and heated with stirring
for 2.0 h at 333 K. The brown solution was filtered and left for
several days, brown crystals had formed that were filtered off,
washed with water, and dried under vacuum.</p>
