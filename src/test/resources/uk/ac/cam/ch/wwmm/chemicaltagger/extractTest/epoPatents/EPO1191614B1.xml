<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to a luminescence device.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">More specifically, the present invention relates to a luminescence device employing an organic metal coordination compound having platinum center metal as a luminescence material so as to allow stable luminescence efficiency, and a display apparatus and an illumination apparatus comprising the luminescence device.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">An organic electroluminescence EL device has been extensively studied as a luminescence device with a high responsiveness and high efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">The organic EL device generally has a sectional structure as shown in <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1A or 1B</figref> (e.g., as described in "<nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Macromol. Symp.", 125, pp. 1 - 48 (1997</text></nplcit>)).</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Referring to the figures, the EL device generally has a structure including a transparent substrate 15, a transparent electrode 14 disposed on the transparent substrate 15, a metal electrode 11 disposed opposite to the transparent electrode 14, and a plurality of organic (compound) layers disposed between the transparent electrode 14 and the metal electrode 11.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1</figref>, the EL device in this embodiment has two organic layers including a luminescence layer 12 and a hole transport layer 13.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The transparent electrode 14 may be formed of a film of ITO (indium tin oxide) having a larger work function to ensure a good hole injection performance into the hole transport layer. On the other hand, the metal electrode 11 may be formed of a layer of aluminum, magnesium, alloys thereof, etc., having a smaller work function to ensure a good electron injection performance into the organic layer(s).</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">These (transparent and metal) electrodes 14 and 11 may be formed in a thickness of 50 - 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The luminescence layer 12 may be formed of, e.g., aluminum quinolinol complex (representative example thereof may include Alq3 described hereinafter) having an electron transporting characteristic and a luminescent characteristic. The hole transport layer 13 may be formed of, e.g., triphenyldiamine derivative (representative example thereof may include α-NPD described hereinafter) having an electron donating characteristic.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">The above-described EL device exhibits a rectification characteristic, so that when an electric field is applied between the metal electrode 11 as a cathode and the transparent electrode 14 as an anode, electrons are injected from the metal electrode 11<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> into the luminescence layer 12 and holes are injected from the transparent electrodes 14.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The thus-injected holes and electrons are recombined within the luminescence layer 12 to produce excitons, thus causing luminescence. At that time, the hole transport layer 13 functions as an electron-blocking layer to increase a recombination efficiency at the boundary between the luminescence layer 12 and the hole transport layer 13, thus enhancing a luminescence efficiency.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1B</figref>, in addition to the layers shown in <figref idref="f0001">Figure 1A</figref>, an electron transport layer 16 is disposed between the metal electrode 11 and the luminescence layer 12, whereby an effective carrier blocking performance can be ensured by separating functions of luminescence, electron transport and hole transport, thus allowing effective luminescence.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The electron transport layer 16 may be formed of, e.g., oxadiazole derivatives.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">In ordinary organic EL devices, fluorescence caused during a transition of luminescent center molecule from a singlet excited state to a ground state is used as luminescence.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">On the other hand, not the above fluorescence (luminescence) via singlet exciton, phosphorescence (luminescence) via triplet exciton has been studied for use in organic EL device as described in, e.g.,<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --> "<nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Improved energy transfer in electrophosphorescent device" (D.F.

<p id="p0019" num="0019">The phosphorescence (luminescence) material used in the luminescence layer 12 has attracted notice. This is because the phosphorescence material is expected to provide a higher luminescence efficiency in principle.</p>
<p id="p0020" num="0020">More specifically, in the case of the phosphorescence material, excitons produced by recombination of carriers comprise singlet excitons and triplet excitons presented in a ratio of 1:3.

<p id="p0021" num="0021">On the other hand, in the case of utilizing phosphorescence caused during transition from the triplet excited state, a resultant luminescence efficiency is expected to be at least three times that of the case of fluorescence in principle.

<p id="p0022" num="0022">The use of phosphorescence based on transition from the triplet excited state has also been proposed in, e.g., Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="JP11329739A"><text>11-329739</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="JP11256148A"><text>JP-A 11-256148</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0003" dnum="JP8319482A"><text>JP-A 8-319482</text></patcit>.</p>
<p id="p0023" num="0023">However, the above-mentioned organic EL devices utilizing phosphorescence have accompanied with a problem of luminescent deterioration particularly in an energized state.</p>
<p id="p0024" num="0024">The reason for luminescent deterioration has not been clarified as yet but may be attributable to such a phenomenon that the life of triplet exciton is generally longer than that of singlet exciton by at least three digits, so that molecule is placed in a higher-energy state for a long period to cause reaction with ambient substance, formation of exciplex<!-- EPO <DP n="8"> --> or excimer, change in minute molecular structure, structural change of ambient substance, etc.</p>
<p id="p0025" num="0025">Accordingly, the (electro)phosphorescence EL device is expected to provide a higher luminescence efficiency as described above, while the EL device is required to suppress or minimize the luminescent deterioration in energized state.</p>

<p id="p0032" num="0032">In the case where a luminescence layer for an organic EL device is formed of a carrier transporting host material and a phosphorescent guest material, a process of emission of light (phosphorescence) may generally involve the following steps:
<ol id="ol0001" compact="compact" ol-style="">
<li>(1) transport of electron and hole within a<!-- EPO <DP n="11"> --> luminescence layer,</li>
<li>(2) formation of exciton of the host material,</li>
<li>(3) transmission of excited energy between host material molecules,</li>
<li>(4) transmission of excited energy from the host material molecule to the guest material molecule,</li>
<li>(5) formation of triplet exciton of the guest material, and</li>
<li>(6) emission of light (phosphorescence) caused during transition from the triplet excited state to the ground state of the guest material.</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="p0033" num="0033">In the above steps, desired energy transmission and luminescence may generally be caused based on various deactivation and competition.</p>
<p id="p0034" num="0034">In order to improve a luminescence efficiency of the EL device, a luminescence center material per se is required to provide a higher yield of luminescence quantum. In addition thereto, an efficient energy transfer between host material molecules and/or between host material molecule and guest material molecule is also an important factor.</p>
<p id="p0035" num="0035">Further, the above-described luminescent deterioration in energized state may presumably relate to the luminescent center material per se or an environmental change thereof by its ambient molecular structure.</p>
<p id="p0036" num="0036">For this reason, our research group has<!-- EPO <DP n="12"> --> extensively investigated an effect of use of the metal coordination compound (platinum complex) having a partial structure of the following formula (1) as the luminescent center material and as a result, has found that the metal coordination compound having the partial structure of formula (1) allows a high-efficiency luminescence (e.g., luminescence efficiency of at least 1 cd/W) with a high brightness (luminance) for a long period (e.g., a luminance half-life of at least 500 hours at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m<sup>2</sup>) (i.e., a decreased luminescent deterioration in energized state).<!-- EPO <DP n="13"> -->

wherein each of N and C represents an atom constituting a cyclic group.<!-- EPO <DP n="14"> --></p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">The metal coordination compound having a partial structure of formula (1) is represented by any one of the following formulas (1-1) or (1-2):

wherein CyN1 and CyN2 independently denote a cyclic group containing a nitrogen atom connected to Pt and capable of having a substituent, and CyC1 and CyC2 independently denote a cyclic group containing a carbon atom connected to Pt and capable of having a substituent, each of the substituents for CyN1, CyN2, CyC1 and CyC2 being selected from the group consisting of a halogen atom; nitro group; a trialkylsilyl group containing three linear or branched alkyl groups each independently having 1 - 8 carbon atoms; and a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 - 20 carbon atoms capable of including one or at least two non-neighboring methylene groups which can be replaced with -O-, -S-, -CO-, -CO-O-, -O-CO-, -CH=CH- or -C≡C- and capable of including a hydrogen atom which can be replaced with a fluorine atom.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">The metal coordination compound is represented by the formula (1-1) or the formula (1-2) in order to allow further improved high-efficient luminance while minimizing the luminescent deterioration in energized state.<!-- EPO <DP n="16"> --></p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">CyN1 and CyN2 in the formulas (1-1) or (1-2), respectively, are a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic group having a pyridine ring structure. Further, CyC1 and CyC2 in the formulas (1-1) or (1-2), respectively, are a substituted or unsubstituted cyclic group selected from the group consisting of thienyl, benzothienyl.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">The metal coordination compound (platinum complex) specifically represented by the above formulas (1-1) or (1-2) causes phosphorescence (luminescence) and is assumed to have a lowest excited state comprising a triplet excited state liable to cause metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT* state). The phosphorescent emission of light (phosphorescence) is produced during the transition from the MLCT* state to the ground state.</p>
<p id="p0041" num="0041">The metal coordination compound used in the present invention has been found to provide a higher phosphorescence yield of 0.05 - 0.9 and a shorter phosphorescence life of 1 - 30 µsec.</p>
<p id="p0042" num="0042">A phosphorescence yield (P(m)) is obtained based on the following equation: <maths id="math0001" num=""><math display="block"><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi></mfenced><mo mathvariant="normal">/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mfenced><mo mathvariant="normal">=</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi></mfenced><mo mathvariant="normal">/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo mathvariant="normal">×</mo><mfenced separators=""><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mfenced><mo mathvariant="normal">/</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">A</mi><mfenced><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi></mfenced></mfenced><mo mathvariant="normal">,</mo></math><img id="ib0007" file="imgb0007.tif" wi="105" he="9" img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></maths> wherein P(m) represents a phosphorescence yield of an<!-- EPO <DP n="17"> --> (unknown) objective luminescent material, P(s) represents a known (standard) phosphorescence yield of standard luminescent material (Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub>), S(m) represents an integrated intensity of (photo-)excited emission spectrum of the objective material, S(s) represents a known integrated intensity of the standard material, A(m) represents an absorption spectrum of an excited light wavelength of the objective material, and A(s) represents a known absorption spectrum of the standard material.</p>
<p id="p0043" num="0043">The shorter phosphorescence life is necessary to provide a resultant EL device with a higher luminescence efficiency. This is because the longer phosphorescence life increases molecules placed in their triplet excited state which is a waiting state for phosphorescence, thus lowering the resultant luminescence efficiency particularly at a higher current density.</p>
<p id="p0044" num="0044">Accordingly, the metal coordination compound used in the present invention is a suitable luminescent material for an EL device with a higher phosphorescence yield and a shorter phosphorescence life.</p>
<p id="p0045" num="0045">In a conventional phosphorescent EL device uses the platinum-porphiline complex (e.g., PtOEP described above) is used as the luminescent material. On the other hand, the metal coordination compound<!-- EPO <DP n="18"> --> used in the present invention has a carbon-platinum bond (C-Pt bond) in its molecular structure, thus particularly effectively exhibiting a heavy atom effect of platinum (Pt) compared to the case of N-Pt bond (in PtOEP). As a result, a spin-orbit interaction is enhanced to realize a higher phosphorescence yield and a shorter phosphorescence life at the same time.</p>
<p id="p0046" num="0046">Further, molecules of the metal coordination compound have a shorter time period wherein they stay in the triplet excited state, thus prolonging the life of the EL device with less deterioration. In this regard, the metal coordination compound used in the present invention has been substantiated to exhibit excellent stability of luminance as shown in Examples described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p0047" num="0047">In the case of phosphorescent (luminescent) material, luminescent characteristics are largely affected by its molecular environment. On the other hand, principal characteristics of the fluorescent material are studied based on photoluminescence</p>
<p id="p0048" num="0048">For this reason, results of photoluminescence of the phosphorescent material do not reflect luminescent characteristics of the resultant EL device in many cases since the luminescent characteristics in the case of the phosphorescent material depend on a magnitude of polarity of ambient host material<!-- EPO <DP n="19"> --> molecules, ambient temperature, presence state of the material (e.g., solid state or liquid state, etc. Accordingly, different from the fluorescent material, it is generally difficult to expect the resultant EL characteristics for the phosphorescent material by simply removing a part of characteristics from photoluminescence results.</p>
<p id="p0049" num="0049">As a feature of molecular structure, the platinum complex has a planar structure, energy transfer of triplet exciton (i.e., energy transfer from host material molecule in the triplet excited state to guest material molecule) is performed based on electron exchange between adjacent molecules (so-called Dexter transfer). Accordingly, a degree of overlapping of electron cloud between adjacent molecules is an important factor, so that the planar (molecular) structure is suitable for efficient energy transfer.</p>
<p id="p0050" num="0050">On the other hand, Ir(ppy)<sub>3</sub> (indium-phenylpyrimidine complex) as used in the above-described conventional EL device has a steric octahedral coordination structure, thus failing to perform efficient energy transfer (Dexter transfer) from host material molecule.</p>

With respect to the light source, it becomes possible to replace a laser light source of laser beam printer currently used widely with the luminescence device according to the present invention. Further, when the luminescence device of the present invention is arranged in independently addressable arrays as an exposure meahs for effecting desired exposure of light to a photosensitive drum for forming an image, it becomes possible to considerably reducing the volume (size) of image forming apparatus.
