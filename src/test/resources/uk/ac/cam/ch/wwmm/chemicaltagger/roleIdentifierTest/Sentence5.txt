To a mixture of nitroalkanes (32 mmol) and sodium methoxide (32 mmol) in anhydrous THF (20 mL) was added vinylketone 1 (a-j) (8 mmol), the solution was stirred for 13 h at 50°C, the mixture was treated with H2O and extracted with Et2O (3 × 20 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine and dried (MgSO4). The solvent was removed to leave an oil which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel. 3-Acetyl-5-nitrohexanoic acid methyl ester (2a) Purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt, 7/3).
