At the solution of sodium (7.5 mmol) in 15 mL of methanol, was added at room temperature the nitro intermediate 2 (5 mmol). After one hour, a solution of H2SO4 (3 mL) in 15 mL of methanol at -50Â°C was added. The mixture was treated with H2O, the methanol was evaporated, and the residue was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed by a solution of NaOH 1% and a solution of NaCl and dried (MgSO4). The solvent was removed to leave oil, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel. 3-Acetyl-5-oxohexanoic acid methyl ester (3a) Purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt, 7/3).
