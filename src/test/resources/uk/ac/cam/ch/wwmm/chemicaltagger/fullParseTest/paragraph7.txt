A mixture of 5-chloro-8-hydroxyquinoline-7-carboxylic acid (0.50 g, 2.24 mmol), benzylamine (0.29 g, 2.68 mmol), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (0.36 g, 2.68 mmol), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (0.51 g, 2.68 mmol), and triethylamine (0.62 mL, 4.47 mmol) in DMF (15 mL) was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in DMSO and subjected to HPLC purification on C-18 stationary phase eluted with water/acetonitrile/TFA mobile phase. Collection and lyophilization of appropriate fractions provide the title compound as yellow solid.
