138 mg of (2-Amino-5-bromo-phenyl)-pyridin-4-yl-methanone and ( 102 mg ) of 4-ethyl-benzenesulfonyl chloride 321 g 4g 200 mls ( 3000 mls ) 3 ml 50 Â°C . The Schiff base 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethylimino)methyl)-6-methoxyphenol reacts with zinc(II) chloride in methanol to form the title complex . It adopts tetrahedron coordination geometry with the Schiff base ligand coordinated via the imine N and the phenolate O atoms . A formal proton transfer of the phenolic hydrogen to the amine N atom occurred leading to the formation of the neutral O / N-bidentate ligand bearing a pendant ammonium group .
