Into a 10 mL pressure vessel equipped with a magnetic stir bar was placed 0.1 g (.266 mmol) 5-bromo-N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-8-hydroxy-1,6-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide (see Example 126), 0.031 g (.27 mmol) N,N-dimethyl-2-(methylamino)acetamide, .726 mL (.8 mmol) N,N-diisopropylethylamine and 5 mL DMF. The vessel was sealed and heated on an oil bath to 135Â°C for 18 hrs., after which the mixture was cooled and the solvent removed in vacuo. The residue was purified by reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column using acetonitrile/water as eluent to give 5-[[2-(dimethylamino)-2-oxoethyl](methyl)amino]-N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-8-hydroxy-1,6-naphthyridine-7-carboxamide.
