Thus, reduction of the azido group of 11 by dihydrogen in the presence of palladium black in ethyl acetate afforded the amino-alcohol 13 which could be submitted to acidic hydrolysis of the O-protective groups to give, after purification by ion-exchange chromatography, the targeted aminocyclitol 15 [20] (95% overall yield from 11).
