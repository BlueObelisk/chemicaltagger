To a solution of 2-methyl-cyclohexanone (3.4 g, 30.3 mmol) in 40.0 mL of CCl4 was added 5.3 g of (NBS) N-bromo-succicinimide (30.0 mmol). The mixture was stirred and refluxed for 4 h heating with a 200 W tungsten lamp. The reaction was cooled, filtered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The resulting oil was dissolved in 10.0 mL of anhydrous pyridine and refluxed for 12 h. The mixture was cooled, diluted with water and extracted with ethyl ether (3 Ã— 5.0 mL).
