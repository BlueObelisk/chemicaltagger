The refined procedure for the synthesis of (I) is as follows: A solution of 2,6-diisopropyl aniline (4.695 g, 26.5 mmol s) and formic acid (7.314 g, 159.0 mmol, 6eq.) in chloroform (20 ml) was refluxed with continuous stirring for 16 hrs. The colour of the solution changed from yellow to green to colorless over the course of the reaction. The solvent and excess formic acid were removed under vacuum to yield the title compound as a white solid. Needle-like single crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained from slow evaporation of a chloroform solution (5.00 g, 92%). 1H-NMR (CDCl3, p.p.m.): Two rotomers observed in 2:1 ratio. Major Rotomer:δ1.19 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 12H, -CH(CH3)2),δ3.08 (septet, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H, -CH(CH3)2)δ6.64 (s(br), 1H, -NH-),δ7.17 (m, 2H, aromatic),δ7.30 (m, 1H, aromatic),δ8.47 (s, 1H, -C(H)=O).13C-NMR (CDCl3, p.p.m.):δ23.74 (CH(CH3)2), d 28.9 (-CH(CH3)2), d 123.6,δ128.7,δ129.9,δ146.2,δ161.0 (-C(H)=O). Minor Rotomer:δ1.20 (d, J = 6.9 Hz, 12H, -CH(CH3)2),δ3.20 (septet, J = 6.9 Hz, 2H, -CH(CH3)2)δ7.02 (d, J = 11.2 Hz, 1H, -NH-),δ7.19 (m, 2H, aromatic),δ7.30 (m, 1H, aromatic),δ8.0 (d, J = 11.2 Hz, 1H, -C(H)=O).13C-NMR (CDCl3, p.p.m.), Major Rotomer:δ23.77 (-CH(CH3)2),δ28.6 (-CH(CH3)2),δ123.9,δ129.0,δ130.4,δ146.9,δ165.9 (-C(H)=O). ESI-MS (m/z): calcd. for C13H19NO; 205.1467, 206.1545 [M+H]+; found; 206.1546 [M+H]+.
