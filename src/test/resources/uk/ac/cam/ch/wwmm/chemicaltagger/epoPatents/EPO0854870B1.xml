<description id="desc" lang="en">
<heading id="h0001"><u style="single">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</u></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to substituted imidazole compounds which have anti-cancer activity. Numerous anti-cancer compounds in unrelated chemical classes have been synthesized or derived from naturally occurring plants and organisms. None are presently available which demonstrate the anti-cancer activity that has been discovered with respect to the compounds of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention demonstrate anti-cancer activity through the antagonism of the kinase, Raf. The <i>raf</i> genes code for a family of proteins which can be oncogenically activated through N-terminal fusion, truncation or point mutations. RAF can be activated and undergoes rapid phosphorylation in response to PDGF, EGF, insulin, thrombin, endothelin, acidic FGF, CSF1 or TPA, as well as in response to oncoproteins v-fms, v-src, v-sis, Hras and polyoma middle T antigen. Antisense constructs which reduce cellular levels of c-Raf, and hence Raf activity, inhibit the growth of oncogene-transformed rodent fibroblasts in soft agar, while exhibiting little or no general cytotoxicity. Since inhibition of growth in soft agar is highly predictive of tumor responsiveness in whole animals, these studies suggest that the antagonism cf RAF is an effective means by which to treat cancers in which RAF plays a role.</p>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Examples of such cancers, where RAF is implicated through overexpression include cancers of the brain, genitourinary tract, lymphatic system, stomach, larynx and lung. More particularly, such examples include histiocytic lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma and small cell lung cancers. Additional examples include cancers in which overexpression or activation of Raf-activating oncogenes (e.g., K-<i>ras</i>, <i>erb</i>-B) is observed. More particularly, such cancers include pancreatic and breast carcinoma.<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Numerous compounds of the present invention also inhibit cytokines and the pathology which is associated with diseases wherein cytokines are present in high levels. Cytokine mediated diseases refers to diseases or conditions in which excessive or unregulated production or activity of one or more cytokines occurs. Interleukin- 1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are cytokines produced by a variety of cells which are involved in immunoregulation and other physiological conditions.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">There are many disease states in which IL-1 is implicated. Included among these diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, endotoxemia, toxic shock syndrome, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease; tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, cachexia; psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis and acute synovitis. Recent evidence also links IL-1 activity to diabetes.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Interleukin-1 has also been demonstrated to mediate a variety of biological activities thought to be important in immunoregulation and other physiological conditions. [See, e.g., <nplcit id="ncit0001" npl-type="s"><text>Dinarello et al., Rev. Infect. Disease, 6, 51 (1984</text></nplcit>)]. The known biological activities of IL-1 include the activation of T helper cells, induction of fever, stimulation of prostaglandin or collagenase production, neutrophil chemotaxis, induction of acute phase proteins and the suppression of plasma iron levels.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">Excessive or unregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production or activity has likewise been implicated in mediating or exacerbating rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcosis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft v. host rejection, allograft rejections, fever and myalgia due to infection, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency<!-- EPO <DP n="3"> --> syndrome (AIDS), AIDS related complex (ARC), keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and pyresis.</p>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">Monokines, such as TNF, have also been shown to activate HIV replication in monocytes and/or macrophages [See <nplcit id="ncit0002" npl-type="s"><text>Poli, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87:782-784 (1990</text></nplcit>)], therefore, inhibition of monokine production or activity aids in limiting HIV progression. TNF has been implicated in various roles with other viral infections, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza virus, and the herpes virus.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine effecting the immune system and hematopoiesis. It is produced by several mammalian cell types in response to agents such as IL-1, and is correlated with disease states such as angiofollicular lymphoid hyperplasia.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic factor first identified and characterized in 1987. Many different names have been applied to IL-8, such as neutrophil attractant/activation protein-1 (NAP-1), monocyte derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), neutrophil activating factor (NAF), and T-cell lymphocyte chemotactic factor. Like IL-1, IL-8 is produced by several cell types, including mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and ketainocytes. Its production is induced by IL-1, TNF and by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IL-8 stimulates a number of cellular functions <i>in vitro</i>. It is a chemoattractant for neutrophils, T-lymphocytes and basophils. It induces histamine release from basophils. It causes lysozomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils, and it has been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD 18) on neutrophils without <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Published International patent applications <patcit id="pcit0001" dnum="WO9314081A"><text>WO93/14081</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit0002" dnum="WO9503297A"><text>WO95/03297</text></patcit> (both SmithKline Beecham Corporation) disclose 2,4,5-triaryl imidazole compounds for use in treating cytokine mediated diseases.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">There remains a need for compounds which are effective for treating cancer in which RAF is implicated, as well as compounds which inhibit, suppress or antagonize the production or activity of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF.<!-- EPO <DP n="4"> --></p>

<p id="p0036" num="0036">The compounds of the present invention are prepared by procedures illustrated in the accompanying schemes. The two general methods for preparation of the imidazole nucleus are outlined in schemes 1 and 2. In the first method a suitably protected picolyl alcohol is deprotonated with a strong base such as n-butyl lithium or lithium diisopropyl amide and the resulting anion is reacted with an appropriate N,O-Dimethylhydroxamide to give a protected alpha hydroxy ketone. The protected alpha hydroxy ketone is then condensed with a suitably functionalized and protected aminoaldehyde in the presence of ammonium acetate, acetic acid and copper acetate. The aldehydes used in the present examples all contain a suitably protected nitrogen atom. After the imidazole nucleus has been formed, the nitrogen is deprotected and then reacted with an appropriate electrophilic reagent to provide the final compounds.</p>
<p id="p0037" num="0037">In the second method, a suitably protected picolyl alcohol is deprotonated with a strong base such as n-butyl lithium or lithium diisopropyl amide and the resulting anion is reacted with an appropriate aryl or alkyl aldehyde to give a mono-protected diol. The protecting group is removed and the resulting diol is oxidized (by the method of Swem or Moffat) to a dione. The dione is then condensed with a suitably functionalized and protected aminoaldehyde in the presence of ammonium acetate in acetic acid to give the imidazole.</p>
<p id="p0038" num="0038">In this same manner, the nitrogen is deprotected and then reacted with an appropriate electrophilic reagent to provide the compounds of formula I.</p>
<p id="p0039" num="0039">An additional method of preparing compounds described in this invention is shown in Scheme 6. The anion of 4-dimethoxymethylpyridine is formed with a strong base such as n-butyllithium<!-- EPO <DP n="21"> --> and quenched with an electrophile e.g. an appropriately substituted benzyl halide. The ketal is then hydrolysed under acidic conditions and an oxime group introduced by treatment with an appropriate alkyl or metal nitrite under acidic coditions. The oximinoketone may then be condensed with a suitably protected heterocyclic aldehyde and an amine to provide an imidazole-N-oxide. Reduction to the corresponding imidazole may then be accomplished under a variety of conditions e.g titanium (III) chloride. Deprotection then affords the desired compounds.</p>
<p id="p0040" num="0040">A further method of preparation of compounds of the present invention is outlined in Scheme 7. The anion of 2-fluoro-4-methylpyridine is formed with strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide and quenched with an appropriately substituted N-methoxy-O-methoxy amide to provide a ketone. An oximino group can then be introduced for example by treatment with an alkyl nitrite under acidic conditions. Condensation with an appropriately protected heterocyclic aldehyde and ammonium acetate in acetic acid affords, after reduction an imidazole. The fluoropyridine substituent can then be displaced by a nucleophile e.g. a primary or secondary amine to give a substituted pyridine, which may be deprotected.<!-- EPO <DP n="22"> -->

<p id="p0062" num="0062">When administered to a patient for the treatment of a disease in which a cytokine or cytokines are implicated, the dosage used can be varied depending upon the type of disease, the age and general condition of the patient, the particular compound administered, the presence or level of toxicity or adverse effects experienced with the drug, and other factors. A representative example of a suitable dosage range is from as<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> low as about 0.01 mg/kg to as high as about 100 mg/kg. However, the dosage administered is generally left to the discretion of the physician.</p>
<p id="p0063" num="0063">The methods of treatment are preferably carried out by delivering the compound of formula I parenterally. The term 'parenteral' as used herein includes intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal administration. The subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. The instant invention can also be carried out by delivering the compound of formula I subcutaneously, intranasally, intrarectally, transdermally or intravaginally.</p>
<p id="p0064" num="0064">The compounds of formula I may also be administered by inhalation. By 'inhalation' is meant intranasal and oral inhalation administration. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration, such as an aerosol formulation or a metered dose inhaler, may be prepared by convention techniques.</p>
<p id="p0065" num="0065">The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of formula I may also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with a second therapeutically active compound.</p>
<p id="p0066" num="0066">The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid, liquid or gas. Exemples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like.

<p id="p0186" num="0186">Human IL-1b can be detected in cell-culture supernatants or whole blood with the following specific trapping ELISA. Ninety-six well plastic plates (Immulon 4; Dynatech) are coated for 12 hours at 4°C with 1 mg/ mL protein-A affinity chromatography purified mouse anti-human IL-1b monoclonal antibody (purchased as an ascites preparation from LAO Enterprise, Gaithersburg Maryland.) diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (-MgCl<sub>2</sub>, -CaCl<sub>2</sub>). The plates are washed with PBS-Tween (Kirkegaard and Perry) then blocked with 1% BSA diluent and blocking solution (Kirkegaard and Perry) for 60 minutes at room temperature followed by washing with PBS Tween. IL-1b standards are prepared from purified recombinant IL-1b produced from E. <i>coli.</i>. The highest concentration begins at 10 ng/ mL followed by 11 two-fold serial dilutions. For detection of IL-1b from cell culture supernatants or blood plasma, 10 - 25 mL of supernatant is added to each test well with 75 - 90 mL of PBS Tween. Samples are incubated at room temperature for 2 hours then washed 6 times with PBS Tween on an automated plate washer (Dennly). Rabbit anti-human IL-1b polyclonal antisera diluted 1:500 in PBS-Tween is added to the plate and incubated for I hour at room temperature followed by six washes with PBS-Tween. Detection of bound rabbit anti-IL-1b IgG is accomplished with Fab' fragments of Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Accurate Scientific) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS-Tween. Peroxidase activity was determined using TMB peroxidase substrate kit (Kirkegaard and Perry) with quantitation of color intensity on a 96-well plate Molecular Devices spectrophotometer set to determine absorbance at 450 nM. Samples are<!-- EPO <DP n="89"> --> evaluated using a standard curve of absorbance versus concentration. Four-parameter logistics analysis generally is used to fit data and obtain concentrations of unknown compounds.</p>
