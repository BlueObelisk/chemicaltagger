ocrystals of 5-nitrouracil with solvent molecules, dioxane, pyridine, DMSO, formamide and ethanol as well as with piperazine, N,N'-dimethylpiperazine, 3-aminopyridine and diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octane obtained by deliberate inclusion, have been examined by X-ray crystallography. The tape structure found in the parent centric form of nitrouracil is retained with some modifications in the cocrystals with dioxane, piperazine, diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octane, N,N'-dimethylpiperazine, pyridine and DMSO, with the guest molecules forming alternate tapes. In cocrystals involving formamide, ethanol and 3-aminopyridine, the molecular tapes exhibit mixed compositions. The observed bonding patterns have been classified into six schemes. Interestingly, quadruple type hydrogen bonding patterns are seen in cocrystals containing 3-aminopyridine or ethanol and water, while a network of acyclic tetrahedral pentamers of water is found in the cocrystal containing diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octane and water.
