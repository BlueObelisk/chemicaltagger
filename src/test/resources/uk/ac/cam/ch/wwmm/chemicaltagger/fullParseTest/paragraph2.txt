A mixture of 124D (0.75 g, 2.9 mmol), iron (0.48 g, 8.6 mmol) and ammonium chloride (0.46 g, 8.6 mmol) in EtOH/H2O (10 mL/3 mL) was refluxed (bath temperature 90Â°C) for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with water, extracted with dichloromethane three times. The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give 124E as a oil.
