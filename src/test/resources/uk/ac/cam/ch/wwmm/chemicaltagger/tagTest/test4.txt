Preparation of Sulfonated Poly(phthalazinone ether ether ketone) 7a. To a 25 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a Dean-stark trap, a condenser, a nitrogen inlet/outlet, and magnetic stirrer was added bisphthalazinone monomer 4 (0.6267 g, 1 mmol), sulfonated difluoride ketone 5 (0.4223 g, 1 mmol), anhydrous potassium carbonate (0.1935 g, 1.4 mmol), 5 mL of DMSO, and 6 mL of toluene. Nitrogen was purged through the reaction mixture with stirring for 10 min, and then the mixture was slowly heated to 140 째C and kept stirring for 2 h. After water generated was azoetroped off with toluene. The temperature was slowly increased to 175 째C. The temperature was maintained for 20 h, and the viscous solution was cooled to 100 째C followed by diluting with 2 mL of DMSO and, thereafter, precipitated into 100 mL of 1:  1 ( v/v ) methanol/water. The precipitates were filtered and washed with water for three times. The fibrous residues were collected and dried at 110 째C under vacuum for 24 h. A total of 0.9423 g of polymer 7a was obtained in high yield of 93%.
