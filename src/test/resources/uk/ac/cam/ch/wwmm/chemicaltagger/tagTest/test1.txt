Synthesis of the brown dropwise Hyperbranched Macroligands via Michael Addition of Butyl or Ethyl Acrylate with HPEI. The synthetic procedure for partially EA- or BA-modified HPEI is exemplified for HPEI25K-EA0.79: 1.00 g of HPEI25K (Mn = 2.50 x 104, 23.3 mmol of amine groups) was dissolved in 5.00 mL of THF, and then 2.52 mL (23.3 mmol) of EA was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and subsequently at 50 Â°C for another 24 h. 6 wt. % at 333 K.
