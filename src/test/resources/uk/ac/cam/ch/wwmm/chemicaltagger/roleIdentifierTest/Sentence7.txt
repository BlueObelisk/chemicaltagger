In our previous exploratory experiments we have demonstrated that niobium pentachloride promotes Diels-Alder reaction in ethyl acetate solution, between 2-cyclohexenone (2) and cyclopentadiene with high stereoselectivity at -78°C (only the endo adduct was obtained). Motivated by this result we decided to investigate the reactions of various 2-cycloenones 1 – 6 (dienophiles) with cyclopentadiene, in the presence of NbCl5, at different temperatures. Rather surprisingly, however, we found that ethyl acetate as solvent, efficient for 2, did not work with cycloenone 3. By using ethyl ether we obtained good results in both cases, so this work was all performed using ethyl ether as solvent.
