A mixture of 124G (150 mg, 0.64 mmol), 3,5-dichlorobenzylamine (153 mg, 0.87 mmol) and aluminum chloride (27 mg, 0.20 mmol) in toluene (8 mL) was refluxed for 4 h under nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was treated with aqueous saturated NaHCO3 solution and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 g, 3.4 mmol) to pH 7. The mixture was extracted with chloroform four times. The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC to give 124H.
