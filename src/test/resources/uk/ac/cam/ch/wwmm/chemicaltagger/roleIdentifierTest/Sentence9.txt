To a solution of niobium pentachloride (0.135 g, 0.5 mmol) in 1.0 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether, maintained at room temperature, reflux or -78°C under nitrogen atmosphere, was added a solution of the cycloenone (1.0 mmol) and cyclopentadiene (5 mmols) in 1.0 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether. The reaction mixture was quenched with a 10% aqueous citric acid solution (2.0 mL, when working at room temperature or reflux) or with a 1:1 solution of water/THF (2.0 mL, when working at -78°C). The mixture was diluted with water (5.0 mL) and solvent (10.0 mL), the organic layer was separated and washed with 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 × 10.0 mL), saturated brine (2 × 10.0 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the products were purified by column chromatography through silica gel using mainly a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (9.5:0.5) as eluent.
