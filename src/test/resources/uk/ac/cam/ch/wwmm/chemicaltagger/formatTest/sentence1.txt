138 mg of (2-Amino-5-bromo-phenyl)-pyridin-4-yl-methanone and (102 mg) of 4-ethyl-benzenesulfonyl chloride 321g 4g 200mls (3000mls) 3ml 50°C. The Schiff base 2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethylimino)methyl)-6-methoxyphenol reacts with zinc(II) chloride in methanol to form the title complex. It adopts tetrahedron coordination geometry with the Schiff base ligand coordinated <i>via</i> the imine N and the phenolate O atoms. A formal proton transfer of the phenolic hydrogen to the amine N atom occurred leading to the formation of the neutral O/N-bidentate ligand bearing a pendant ammonium group.
