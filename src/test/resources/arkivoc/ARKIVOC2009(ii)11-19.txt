Synthesis of ethyl benzocoumarin-3- carboxylate (2). A mixture of 2-hydroxy-1-
naphthaldehyde (2.9 mmol) 1, an equivalent amount of diethyl malonate (2.9 mmol), and
catalytic amount of piperidine in ethanol (30 mL) was refluxed for 30 minutes on water bath14.
After the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and
poured into crushed ice with stirring. The precipitate obtained was then filtered, washed with
water, dried and recrystallised using ethanol to get pure 2.

Synthesis of benzocoumarin-3-carbohydrazide (3). A mixture of ethyl benzocoumarin-3-
carboxylate 2 (3.8 mmol) and hydrazine hydrate (3.8 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol and
refluxed on waterbath for 2 hr. After the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was cooled
to room temperature and poured into crushed ice with stirring. The separated solid was filtered,
washed with water, dried and recrystallised with ethanol to get pure yellow compound 3.

Synthesis of 3-Benzocoumarin- 5- (undecanyl) – 1, 3, 4 oxadiazole (4a). To the mixture of
benzocoumarin-3-carbohydrazide 3 (2.0 mmol), lauric acid (2.0 mmol) 10ml of phosphorous
oxychloride was added and then it was refluxed for about 12-15 hr on water bath and cooled to
room temperature.The mixture was poured into crushed ice with stirring and it was neutralized
by using saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The yellow precipitate obtained was filtered,
washed with water, dried and purified through column chromatography by using ethyl acetate
and petroleum ether (1:9) as the elutent. Similarly the compounds 4b-e were synthesized.
