<p id="p0853" num="0853">To a solution of 2,2,2-trifluoro-<i>N</i>-{2-(methyloxy)-5-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-phenyl}acetamide (680 mg, 2.16 mmol) in THF (50 mL) was added dropwise 1.0 M TBAF in THF (2.59 ml, 2.59 mmol) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at rt. The reaction was quenched with H<sub>2</sub>O (50 mL), concentrated under reduced pressure, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2 x 50 mL). The organic layers were combined, solvent removed under reduced pressure, and purified by column chromatography (5-25% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the title compound (500 mg, 96%) as an off white solid. <spectrum><sup>1</sup>H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl<sub>3</sub>) Î´ 3.00 (s, 1H), 3.93 (s, 3H), 6.86 (d, 1 H, J = 8.42 Hz), 7.31 (dd, 1 H, J = 8.42 Hz, 2.01 Hz), 8.46 (d, 1 H, J = 2.01 Hz)</spectrum>.</p>
