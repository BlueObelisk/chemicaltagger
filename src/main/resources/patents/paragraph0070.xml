<p id="p0282" num="0282">To a 25 mL round bottomed flask with a stirring bar was added 8-hydroxy-5-phenylsulfanyl-[1,6]naphthyridine-7-carboxylic acid 3,5-dichlorobenzylamide (0.04g, 0.09 mmol) and methanol (7 mL). To this well stirred solution was added a solution of Oxone® (DuPont trademark; potassium peroxymonosulfate) (0.184g, 0.30 mmol) in water (2 mL). The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at ambient temperature 20h. The solvents were removed <i>in vacuo</i> and the residue was triturated with water (10 mL) for 30 min. The solid was collected by filtration on a frit. This material was purified by reverse phase chromatography using water/acetonitrile as eluant to give 5-benzenesulfonyl-8-hydroxy-[1,6]naphthyridine-7-carboxylic acid 3,5-dichloro-benzylamide as a solid.<br/>
