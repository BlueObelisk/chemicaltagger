A. ChemicalTagger Components:
-----------------------------

    This package is used for marking up experimental sections in chemistry papers:
    It has 3 main classes:
    
        I. ChemistryPOSTagger: 
        ---------------------
        This class takes a sentence and runs it against three taggers:
             -OSCAR (for chemical entities)
             -Regex (for recognising chemistry related entities)
             -OpenNLP (for english parts of speech)
             
        II. ChemistrySentenceParser: 
        ---------------------------
           This class converts a tagged sentence into a parseTree. It uses a lexer and parser generated
        by the Antlr grammar.     
                 
        III. ASTtoXML: 
        ---------------------------
        This class converts an abstract tree into an XML document.
     

B. Running chemicalTagger:
-------------------------

public void parseChemicalSentence(){

        String text = "A solution of 124C (7.0 g, 32.4 mmol) in concentrate H2SO4 (9.5 mL) was added to a solution of concentrate H2SO4 (9.5 mL) and fuming HNO3 (13 mL) and the mixture was heated at 60°C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was added to iced 6M solution of NaOH (150 mL) and neutralized to pH 6 with 1N NaOH solution. The reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (4x100 mL). The combined organic phases were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to give 124D as a solid."; 
        // Calling ChemistryPOSTagger
        POSContainer posContainer = ChemistryPOSTagger.getInstance().runTaggers(text);
        
        // Returns a string of TAG TOKEN format (e.g.: DT The NN cat VB sat IN on DT the NN matt)
        String tagged = posContainer.getTokenTagTupleAsString();

        InputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(tagged.getBytes("UTF-8"));
       
        // Pass the input stream to ChemistrySentenceParser
        ChemistrySentenceParser chemistrySentenceParser = new ChemistrySentenceParser(
                in);


        Tree t = chemistrySentenceParser.parseTags();

        // Convert the AST tree to an XML document
        ASTtoXML ast2XML = new ASTtoXML();
        
        // For plain xml use:
        Document doc = ast2XML.convert(t);


        // To include assigning actions use
        Document doc = ast2XML.convert(t,true);
        
        Utils.writeXMLToFile(doc,"target/file1.xml");
     }
